## Sign-in

There are multiple ways to sign-in to Chief Tools and option to secure your account.

### Username and password

With Chief Tools your username is your e-mail adddress, you can change the e-mail address used in your [profile](https://account.chief.app/account/profile) if required.

You can also update your password from your [account](https://account.chief.app/account/password) page.

### Two-factor

You can (optionally, though recommended) enable TOTP (like Google Authenticator or 1Password) to secure your account further by requiring that a code generated by a TOTP client has to be entered every time you login.

### Social login

You can (optionally) [connect](https://account.chief.app/account/social) your account to sing-in with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or Apple. This allows a convienent way to login without entering your username and password.

If you feel the social account connected to your account are sufficently secured already you can choose to bypass two-factor when signing in with a social account from your [preferences](https://account.chief.app/account/preferences).
