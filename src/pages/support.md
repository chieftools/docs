## Documentation

The first place you've already found, this [documentation site](https://docs.chief.tools). We try to document common cases and answer frequently asked questions about the tools we provide.

## Roadmap

We have a public roadmap where our users can vote on features and suggest new ones. You can find it at [roadmap.chief.tools](https://roadmap.chief.tools?ref=chiefdocs) and login with your Chief Tools account to participate.

## Contact us

If you have a question that is not answered here, need help with something or have a private matter, please [contact us](https://chief.app/contact?ref=chiefdocs) and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.
