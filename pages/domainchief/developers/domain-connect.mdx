description: Learn how to integrate your service with Domain Chief domains using the Domain Connect protocol for automated DNS configuration.
---

Domain Connect is an open protocol specification that enables automated DNS configuration between Service Providers (such as hosting, email, and SaaS platforms) and DNS Providers. It simplifies DNS setup for end users by allowing services to automatically configure DNS records without manual intervention.

## Overview

The Domain Connect protocol uses a template-based approach where DNS configurations are defined in JSON templates. When a user wants to connect a domain to your service, Domain Chief can automatically apply the necessary DNS records based on your template.

### Key Benefits

- **No manual DNS configuration** - Users don't need to copy/paste DNS records
- **Reduced support burden** - Fewer DNS configuration errors and support tickets
- **Faster onboarding** - Users can start using your service immediately
- **Standardized integration** - Same protocol works across all Domain Connect-enabled providers

## How It Works

The Domain Connect protocol follows these steps:

1. **Discovery** - Your application queries the domain's `_domainconnect` TXT record to find the DNS provider's Domain Connect endpoints
2. **Template Check** - Verify that the DNS provider supports your specific template
3. **Application** - Redirect the user to the provider's apply endpoint with your template parameters
4. **Confirmation** - The user reviews and confirms the DNS changes
5. **Completion** - DNS records are automatically created, and the user is redirected back to your application

## Supported Flow

Domain Chief supports the **synchronous (interactive) flow** of the Domain Connect protocol. This flow requires user interaction to review and confirm DNS changes before they are applied.

The asynchronous OAuth-based flow is not currently supported.

## Template Discovery

Unlike some DNS providers, **Domain Chief automatically discovers and indexes Domain Connect templates daily**. You do not need to contact us for template onboarding - simply publish your template according to the Domain Connect specification, and it will be automatically discovered if every feature is supported.

## Testing Your Template

You can test your Domain Connect template integration with Domain Chief by using the following test domain: `domainchief.app`. This domain is configured to use Domain Chief's DNS and will allow you to verify that your template is discovered and supported.

### Template Requirements

Your templates must be:

- Publicly accessible at the standard Domain Connect template URL format
- Compliant with the Domain Connect v2 specification
- Properly formatted JSON with all required fields

If your template is not being discovered, or you need to test a template before it's publicly available, contact [domainconnect@chief.app](mailto:domainconnect@chief.app).

## Requirements

For Domain Connect to work with a Domain Chief domain:

- The domain must be using **Domain Chief's hosted DNS** (nameservers must be pointing to Domain Chief)
- If your template specifies `hostRequired: true`, a valid `host` parameter must be provided
- The template must be publicly available and indexed by Domain Chief

If these requirements are not met, the discovery step will show your template as unsupported.

## Limitations

- **Synchronous flow only** - The OAuth-based asynchronous flow is not supported
- **Hosted DNS required** - Only works with domains using Domain Chief's nameservers
- **Template-based configuration** - Direct DNS record manipulation is not available through Domain Connect
