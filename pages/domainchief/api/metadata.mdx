description: Learn how to attach custom metadata to domains, contacts, and DNS records via the Domain Chief API.
---

Metadata allows you to attach custom key-value pairs to certain objects in the Domain Chief API. This is useful for storing additional information or associating your own identifiers with Domain Chief resources.

## Supported Objects

Metadata can be attached to the following objects:

- **Domains** - When registering or updating a domain
- **Contacts** - When creating or updating a contact
- **DNS Records** - When creating or updating a DNS record

## Use Cases

Metadata is particularly useful for:

- Storing your internal identifiers or reference numbers
- Tagging resources for organizational purposes
- Tracking additional information not captured by standard fields
- Integrating Domain Chief with your own systems

## Adding Metadata

Metadata is provided as a JSON object where keys and values must be strings. You can include metadata when creating or updating supported objects.

### Example: Registering a Domain with Metadata

```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "is_using_hosted_dns": true,
  "metadata": {
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "project": "website-redesign",
    "department": "marketing"
  }
}
```

### Example: Creating a Contact with Metadata

```json
{
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "address_street": "Main Street",
  "address_house_number": "123",
  "address_postal_code": "1234AB",
  "address_city": "Amsterdam",
  "address_country_code": "NL",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "phone": "+31 20 1234567",
  "metadata": {
    "crm_id": "CRM-98765",
    "account_type": "premium"
  }
}
```

### Example: Creating a DNS Record with Metadata

```json
{
  "type": "A",
  "name": "www",
  "content": "192.0.2.1",
  "ttl": 3600,
  "metadata": {
    "service": "web-server",
    "environment": "production"
  }
}
```

## Updating Metadata

When updating an object, the metadata you provide is **merged** with existing metadata, not replaced entirely.

### Adding or Updating a Metadata Key

To add a new key or update an existing one, simply include it in the metadata object:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "new_key": "new_value"
  }
}
```

### Removing a Specific Metadata Key

To remove a specific metadata key, set its value to an empty string:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "key_to_remove": ""
  }
}
```

### Removing All Metadata

To remove all metadata from an object, set the metadata field to an empty object:

```json
{
  "metadata": {}
}
```

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to metadata:

### Keys
- Must be strings
- Cannot exceed **40 characters**
- Cannot contain `[` or `]` characters

### Values
- Must be strings
- Cannot exceed **500 characters**

### Total Keys
- An object cannot have more than **50 metadata keys**

## Validation Examples

### Valid Metadata

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "project_name": "Q4-2023-Website-Redesign",
    "contact_email": "admin@example.com",
    "notes": "This is a short note about the resource"
  }
}
```

### Invalid Metadata

The following examples show invalid metadata that will be rejected by the API:

**Key contains `[` or `]` characters:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "customer[id]": "12345"
  }
}
```

**Value is not a string:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "count": 123
  }
}
```

## Retrieving Metadata

When you retrieve an object that has metadata, it will be included in the response as a `metadata` field:

```json
{
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "metadata": {
    "customer_id": "12345",
    "project": "website-redesign",
    "department": "marketing"
  }
}
```

If an object has no metadata, the `metadata` field will be an empty object `{}`.

## UI Integration

<Callout type="tip">
    Metadata is displayed in the Domain Chief web interface with special handling for certain values.
</Callout>

### URLs

When a metadata value contains a valid URL (starting with `https://`), it will automatically become clickable in the Domain Chief UI, making it easy to navigate to external resources.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "documentation": "https://docs.example.com/project-123",
    "monitoring": "https://status.example.com/dashboard"
  }
}
```

### Special Metadata Keys for Domains

The `external_url` metadata key has special meaning when set on a domain. It will display a prominent button in the Domain Chief UI, providing quick access to the external resource.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "is_using_hosted_dns": true,
  "metadata": {
    "domain_id": "1234",
    "external_url": "https://example.com/manage-domain/1234"
  }
}
```

This is particularly useful for linking domains to external management tools, customer portals, or related resources.

## Best Practices

- **Use descriptive keys** - Choose clear, meaningful key names that make it easy to understand what each metadata entry represents.
- **Keep values concise** - While values can be up to 500 characters, shorter values are easier to work with and display.
- **Use consistent naming** - Establish a naming convention for your metadata keys (e.g., snake_case, camelCase) and stick to it.
- **Don't store sensitive data** - Metadata is stored as plain text and may be visible in logs and API responses. Don't use it for passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
- **Plan your key structure** - With a limit of 50 keys per object, think about how you'll organize your metadata to stay within this limit.
