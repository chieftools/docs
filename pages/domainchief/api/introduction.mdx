description: A quick introduction to the Domain Chief API, what it does and how to use it.

The Domain Chief API allows you to programmatically interact with Domain Chief. You can use the API to perform any action that you can perform via the web interface.

You can authenticate with the API using [Personal Access Tokens](/accountchief/tokens#personal-access-tokens). In the [playground](/api/domainchief) you can login using your Domain Chief account credentials to try out requests.
