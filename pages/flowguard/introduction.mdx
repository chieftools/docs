description: A quick introduction to FlowGuard, what it does and how to use it.

FlowGuard is a <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/chieftools/flowguard-proxy">open-source reverse proxy</ExternalLink> solution built to provide robust security and traffic management for web applications. It operates by intercepting incoming HTTP and HTTPS requests, allowing administrators to define dynamic rules for filtering and controlling traffic based on various criteria such as IP addresses, request patterns, and more.

In addition we provide a <ExternalLink href="https://flowguard.network">control plane</ExternalLink> that allows for easy management and monitoring of multiple FlowGuard instances from a centralized dashboard. The control plane provides features such as real-time analytics, rule management, and integration with external threat intelligence sources.
