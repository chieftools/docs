## What are Chief Tools?

Chief Tools is a collection of online tools. Most of the tools started from side projects to fill a need at the time or to improve on existing solutions.
Since 2015 Chief Tools has been expanding on these tools and we are happy to share them with you!
We try to keep them useful for ourselves and for you and maybe most importantly free or affordable for everyone.
